## Conclusion

The Maven Toy Shop Sales Analysis project utilized Power BI to integrate, analyze, and visualize key business performance indicators across sales, profit, inventory, and store locations. The goal of this analysis was to provide actionable insights that support data-driven decision making and operational optimization.
The findings revealed that Downtown stores consistently outperformed other locations, contributing the highest share of total sales and profit. Product categories such as Toys and Sports & Outdoors were identified as the most profitable, while Electronics showed lower profit margins and potential areas for strategic improvement.
Seasonal sales patterns indicated moderate growth in the first half of the year, followed by a dip during mid-year months, and recovery towards year-end. This trend highlights the importance of strategic sales campaigns and inventory planning during peak and low-demand periods.
From an inventory management perspective, the analysis confirmed there were no significant lost sales due to stockouts, suggesting efficient stock control. However, continuous monitoring of demand fluctuations and proactive stock replenishment strategies are recommended to sustain this efficiency.
The Power BI dashboard developed serves as an interactive decision support system that consolidates critical KPIs, enabling management to track performance across stores, products, and time periods. It provides a foundation for ongoing performance monitoring, forecasting, and scenario analysis.
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how a well-structured business intelligence system can provide visibility, accountability, and foresight into retail operations. By leveraging these insights, Maven Toy Shop can enhance profitability, optimize inventory levels, and strengthen its competitive position in the market.
